### "Flow chart" - Core features through to "features"

Funding
  - Will be collected through various methods, tax, sales etc. Without funding the city won't be able to hire many civil servants
  - Funds will mostly be stored inside the city vault, which can/will be robbed. The mayor will need to make sure the city has hired enough police. The mayor can set the salary for his/hers officers, and this will ultimately deicide how many officers can be hired. If the vault is robbed, or not enough money is being collected, then some of the officers will lose a there jobs, and the city will become less defended
  - Seizures and fines will also be counted towards the budget.
  - The mayor can allocate funds, to purchase better weapons and equipment for his/hers officers.
  - The mayor, if enough funds are available, can run a national lottery. 
  - If not enough players are online, there will be a default but random government economy in place.
  - The mayor, may accept donations from members of the public, from citizens trying to better there city, or maybe somebody want's a blind eye turned, or is trying to have a law pushed in there favour.
  - The mayor may also open sell bonds, which will later have to be repaved with a the interests agreed originally. Only the bond holder may choose to accept/discount a lower price. 

Mayor
  - Legal protector of the city and funds
  - Job will be lost on death
  - Control the cities funds
  - Hand out gun licence
  - Salary will be a % of the cities total funds.
  - increase/decrease taxes
  - Change laws
  - Lock-down city
  - Set bail for players
  - Purchase equipment/weapons for the police 
  - Set civil servants salaries + amount of whom can be hired

GUI / Ent
- Will have a UI the mayor can open to controll everything
- May have a ENT the mayor can use to do the same

# Other modules that will be mixed in with this
  - Bank Vault
  - Core LiquidRP (jobs. salary, laws, money)
  - Casino Vault
  - Lottery

TODO
=====
Government funding needs to be separated into "buckets", so each budget category has it's own little bank for instance, and only combined for display purposes and the vault. Maybe abandon the budget feature all together, and just use the funds, and have everything government related come out of it still.

Things like lottery can be a % of the funds, if the funds are higher than x value.
Mayor can purchase weapons for the vault if he wants
If the government can't afford to pay wages, for example a police officers, then a % of the total wage will be payed form a "emergency fund", but the mayor won't be able to receive a paycheck at all.

<s>I was thinking, and this is suppose to be semi-serious role play, plus i don't like the messy code that's coming from it. Also the budgeting is not working as it's suppose to be, never mind i just noticed my logic is flawed, anyway still going to abandon this section. (I am still learning lua lol)</s>

<h5>I've picked the project back up, along with this section again. See</h5>
