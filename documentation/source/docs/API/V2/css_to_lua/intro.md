I have created a library designed to streamline the creation of elegant HUDs. Drawing inspiration from CSS's core features, it offers a versatile set of functionalities to enhance your design process. Built on top of GMod's draw and surface libraries, this tool is tailored for modifying or adding HUDs exclusively within this game mode. However, its versatile design also allows for integration into your own projects, providing flexibility for further customization and development.

## Key Features:

- Box Model: Effortlessly manage the layout and structure of your HUD elements.
- Padding: Fine-tune spacing within your HUD components for optimal presentation.
- Margin: Control the space between individual HUD elements with precision.

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the API reference provided.
