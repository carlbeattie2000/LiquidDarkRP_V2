LiquidRP
========

Brief
========
The original Liquid DarkRP by Jackool and then Deadman123, updated for Garry's Mod 13.

Description
========
As it stands right now, Liquid DarkRP (shortened to LiquidDRP, or LDRP) is a modification of FPtje's DarkRP gamemode (https://github.com/FPtje/DarkRP) for Garry's Mod. It was originally hosted on Google Code (https://code.google.com/p/liquid-darkrp/), after which it was brought up to date for Garry's Mod 13, and then moved to GitHub where it is now. Most, if not all of the bugs have been ironed out, and this particular project should be as close to the original LDRP as it was pre-GMod 13.

Current build should be stable, ironing out most bugs. Know game breaking bug is not being able to create votes for jobs.

Full list of commands and basic scripting for the gamemode being released soon

# NOTE: BUGS ARE PRESENT IN CURRENT BUILDS
