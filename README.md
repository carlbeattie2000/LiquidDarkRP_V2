LiquidRP (Rebellion RP)
========
<h2>Important Information: RebellionRP's future</h1>

```
Last year I abandoned this project. I found myself spending too much of my "should be" development time, learning/ researching fundamental CS principles that I should've learned already, and fighting with how I was structuring the project and my code. I've spent some time since then just focusing on improving my fundamental CS knowledge. 

So over the last few weeks I've been creating a 2D game engine and this project has popped into my head at least 100 times. I remembered trying to learn LUA when I was 13 nearly ten years ago desperate to make Dark RP add-ons and a clone of some popular modified Dark RP based game modes. I was struggling to get a simple script to run, I had high expectations and had skipped learning the basics like variables, conditionals, and loops, not to mention my inability to read and comprehend documentation back then. The project is back in development, and I'm unsure if I will rewrite everything from the ground up or continue where I left off. 

I think the best bet is to have an experiment with the project in its current state, and then decide what I will do. This time I will pace out the time spent on the project, and not have it as my main focus. 

TLDR;
This is a passion project, I want to complete it, either rewrite everything from the ground up, not using Liquid RP as the base, or continue where I left off, either way, It will be functional with what I originally planned.
