LiquidRP
========

Brief
========
The original Liquid DarkRP by Jackool and then Deadman123, updated for Garry's Mod 13.

Description
========
As it stands right now, Liquid DarkRP (shortened to LiquidDRP, or LDRP) is a modification of FPtje's DarkRP gamemode (https://github.com/FPtje/DarkRP) for Garry's Mod. It was originally hosted on Google Code (https://code.google.com/p/liquid-darkrp/), after which it was brought up to date for Garry's Mod 13, and then moved to GitHub where it is now. Most, if not all of the bugs have been ironed out, and this particular project should be as close to the original LDRP as it was pre-GMod 13.

Plans
========
Simply put, modernize the UI and some of the outdated features, then add a few extra modules before moving on to adding advanced features.
