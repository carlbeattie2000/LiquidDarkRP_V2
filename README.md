# LiquidDRP V2
I've copied this over to the current main branch as i'm currently working on rebuilding/upgrading the orignal LiquidDRP to DarkRP 2.7.0.
When I first started this project I failed to notice the DarkRP version it was running was nearly 10 years old. It will be much easier
this way, I will have the latest DarkRP as the base, and will be able to rewrite the LiquidDRP gamemode with updated standards, while also modernizing it.
This will be my hobby project until S&Box is released, then I'll port this over to S&Box.

The original Liquid DarkRP by Jackool and then Deadman123, updated for Garry's Mod 13, now being updated to DarkRP 2.7.0.

# Description
As it stands right now, Liquid DarkRP (shortened to LiquidDRP, or LDRP) is a modification of FPtje's DarkRP gamemode (https://github.com/FPtje/DarkRP) for Garry's Mod.
It was originally hosted on Google Code (https://code.google.com/p/liquid-darkrp/), after which it was brought up to date for Garry's Mod 13, and then moved to GitHub where it is now.
Most, if not all of the bugs have been ironed out, and this particular project should be as close to the original LDRP as it was pre-GMod 13.

This is where I come in, I was fixing and adding new features before I realised how outdated it was from the current DarkRP version and was a big mess.
I'm hoping to rebuild the gamemode starting with the latest version of DarkRP as the base.

You can view my previous mess on the other branches.

This is what I said three months ago.
`I think the best bet is to have an experiment with the project in its current state, and then decide what I will do. This time I will pace out the time spent on the project, and not have it as my main focus.`
Well I have revistied it, played around, tried rebuilding a feature that already exists, but easier to work and have now come to the decision it will just be better to rewrite from the base.

I was using Windows while I was playing around rebuilding the feature, that was adding to my frustration. Spaming Alt-Tab twenty times to get to the window I want is unpleasant. Setting up my glua dev
environment will be my first priority.
