LiquidRP
========

Brief
========
The original Liquid DarkRP by Jackool and then Deadman123, updated for Garry's Mod 13.

Description
========
As it stands right now, Liquid DarkRP (shortened to LiquidDRP, or LDRP) is a modification of FPtje's DarkRP gamemode (https://github.com/FPtje/DarkRP) for Garry's Mod. It was originally hosted on Google Code (https://code.google.com/p/liquid-darkrp/), after which it was brought up to date for Garry's Mod 13, and then moved to GitHub where it is now. Most, if not all of the bugs have been ironed out, and this particular project should be as close to the original LDRP as it was pre-GMod 13.

Going Forward
========
Feel free to pull from this and make your own modifications - that's the beautiful thing about open source. Keep in mind that this version of LDRP is not on the latest version of DarkRP's base (much to FPTje's distress), so don't expect all of the features that you can find in DarkRP.

I personally plan to branch this and make my own modifications to it, hopefully merging it with the latest version of DarkRP and make it modular to fit with DarkRP's current design.
